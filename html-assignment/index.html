            Hey! My name is Fanyi Qian, and most of my friends call me <em>Jasmine</em>. 
        I was born in China but currently living in Ottawa. I graduated from 
        Boston University three years ago, majoring in Art History. I worked 
        for my parents for two years after graduation and am currently back 
        in school to study Interactive Media Design as a 1<sup>st</sup> year student for 
        a career change.
    </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy experiencing different cultures and have traveled to nine 
        countries and regions in the world. I am a big fan of Asian cuisine, 
        especially Thai and Cantonese food. I took some Korean and Japanese 
        courses as a third and fourth language my sophomore year, so I speak 
        a little bit of Korean and Japanese other than Chinese and English.
        As an animal lover, I donate to shelters regularly and have helped 
        rescuing stray cats a few times. I have two cats living with my parents
        in China. Besides, I love listening to <abbr title="Rhythm and blues">
        R&B</abbr> music and watching true crime documentaries in my spare time.
         </p>
         <p>
            I believe that it is important for us to cherish every little moment
        in our lives, so I think it is nice to end this self-introduction with 
        one of my favorite quotes:
    </p>
